INTRODUCTION
------------
This repository manages wdtp (Wine debugger testing package), a set of
tools to test WineDbg.

It consists of:
- a program to drive WineDbg by passing commands to it, and checking
  the output of those commands (wdbgtest),
- a set of unit tests. Each test is made of a:
  + a simple C program
  + a script to drive the commands to be sent to WineDbg by wdbgtest,
    and their expected output.
  Those simple C programs are run under WineDbg.
  In current configuration, all tests are compiled into a single
  executable, each test being chosen from a command line
  parameter. This executable is called wdtp.
  By convention, a simple test (<test>)'s C file is named
  wdtp_<test>.c and the script file <test>.wdtp.
- actually, the wtdp executable is compiled several times, using
  different ways. The final executable is called a flavor of
  wdtp. Each flavor corresponds to a unique set of options to cover
  different elements, among which:
  + compiler: gcc, msvc, MingW...
  + compiler version (if several chains are installed)
  + debug format: stabs, Dwarf2, Codeview, PDB...
  + compiler options: mostly optimisations
  + linker option: debug info stripping, prelinking

   +-------------+        +---------+       +--------------------------+
   |   wdbgtest  | <====> | WineDbg | ----> | wdtp_<flavor>.exe <test> |
   +-------------+        +---------+       +--------------------------+
   | <test>.wdtp |                          |     <test>.c program     |
   +-------------+                          +--------------------------+

Currently, the flavor name is made of:
- name of compiler (gcc, mingw32...)
- an underscore
- a condensed string made out of the options (generally made out of
  debug format and compiler options)
- the default executable extension (.exe for PEs, .exe.so for Wine modules)

For now, the test suite must be compiled and run against a regular
Wine compilation tree (not against an installed Wine setup).

The WDTP file describes the syntax of .wdtp files.

LICENSING
---------
This package is provided under the LGPL license (see LICENSE file).

CONFIGURATION & BUILDING
------------------------
First, from the directory where you installed the package, run:
	autoconf

Then, if you compile Wine in the Wine source tree, then configuration
is done with:
	./configure --with-wine=<wine_src_dir>
where <wine_src_dir> is the path to the top of your Wine source tree.

Or, if you compile Wine outside the Wine source tree, then
configuration is done with:
	./configure --with-wine=<wine_src_dir> \
		--with-wine-output=<wine_dst_dir>
where <wine_src_dir> is the path to the top of your Wine source tree,
and <wine_dst_dir> is the path to the top of your Wine object tree.

If you want to enable mingw32 cross-compilation, use the
--with-mingw32 option to give the name of the version of the
cross-compiler you want to use. For example:
	./configure --with-wine=<wine_src_dir> \
		--with-mingw32=i586-pc-mingw32-gcc

If you want to enable MS Visual C++ compilation (the compiler will be
run with Wine), use the --with-msvc option to give the top directory
where MS Visual C++ is. For example:
	./configure --with-msvc=/home/winapps/Microsoft\ Visual\ C++\ Toolkit\ 2003

In all cases, finalize the installation by building the lot:
	make depend && make

RUNNING & TESTING
-----------------
As already mentionned, wdtp is compiled with different "flavors". We
currently support:
- gcc_stabspO0:     gcc, stabs+ debug format, no optimization
- gcc_dwarfO0:      gcc, dwarf2 debug format, no optimization
- gcc_dwarfO2:      gcc, dwarf2 debug format, optimization at regular level
- mingw32_stabspO0: cross-compilation with mingw32, stabs+ debug
		    format, no optimization
- msvc_pdbOd:	    msvc, PDB format, no optimization

To test one flavor, use (for example):
	make test_gcc_stabspO0
It will run all available tests with the defined flavor.

To run all the tests for all flavors, do:
	make test_all

To run all the tests for a given compiler, do:
	make test_gcc

All flavors are not equally supported:
- the gcc_{dwarf, stabsp}O0 should be ok (they may provide two errors
  in minidump.wdtp and stack.wdtp for some gcc versions, but that's
  the current behavior)
- gcc_dwarfO2 produces a couple of errors (execute: mishandling of
  instruction reordering, which mixes insn from different lines;
  minidump and stack: the ELF ABI enforces saving some registers on
  the stack, and winedbg/dbghelp doesn't handle it correctly)
- mingw32_stabspO0 produces a couple of errors, that should be fixed

DEPENDENCIES
------------
A full blown Wine tree, with all the tools needed to compile it (gcc,
make, flex, bison).
On top of that:
- autoconf (mandatory)
- mingw32 for cross-compilation (optional)
- Microsoft Visual C++ for cross-compilation (optional)

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Enhancements
- Provide enhanced configuration tools to help defining support for a
  new compiler, different sets of options for a compiler...
- Set up a nicer way to define a new test flavor (extra tool in
  autoconf ??)

Known bugs
- Setting a breakpoint on a line number which doesn't exist in debug
  info is not supported
- Getting a backtrace on an address without any known function to the
  debugger (or line number info) isn't supported
- A backtrace where '(nil)' is used isn't properly supported

Things to do:
- why using the EVAL command for 'set' (could also get rid of mv_null
  in EVAL)
